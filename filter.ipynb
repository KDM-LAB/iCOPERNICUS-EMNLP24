Guggenheim securities upped its price target for the company to $300 from $275. Watch Adobe trade live . Adobe , the company behind Photoshop, topped Wall Street estimates during the second quarter of 2019, sending shares up more than 4% before the opening bell on Wednesday. After the closing bell on Tuesday, Adobe reported year-over-year revenue growth of 25% for the second quarter, hitting $2.74 billion. That exceeded analyst estimates of $2.7 billion. Earnings per share of $1.83 also beat Wall Street estimates of $1.78. \"Adobe\\'s continued momentum is being fueled by the explosion of creativity across the globe and the widespread business transformation agenda to deliver engaging customer experiences,\" Shantanu Narayen, president and CEO of Adobe, said in a press release on Wednesday. Adobe\\'s Digital Media business, which includes brand-name cloud services like Photoshop and Premiere, generated $1.89 billion in revenue, a 22% increase from the second quarter last year. The company also added an additional $406 million in annual reccuring revenue to its digital media business. Guggenheim Securities increased its price target for Adobe to $300 from $275 and maintained its \"Neutral\" rating after the company\\'s second quarter results. \"Our forecasts underestimated the sustainability of Adobe\\'s core business and the leverage that would flow through once the M&A headwinds subsided and synergies started to flow through,\" Ken Wong, an analyst at Guggenheim said in a research note on Wednesday.

For decades, the most well-known and lauded directors in Hollywood have tended to be men. For reference, only one woman has ever won the Academy Award for best director. But more and more women are getting into the field, including Olivia Wilde , who transitions from actress to feature-film director with the comedy \"Booksmart,\" which hits theaters on May 24, 2019. After directing the 2011 short \"Free Hugs,\" Olivia wanted to do it again on a bigger scale. \"I was electrified and I knew at that point, that\\'s what I really wanted to do,\" she told Entertainment Weekly. As for why she chose this project, she explained, \"I\\'m really inspired by the teen comedies that inspired me when I was younger, and [\\'Booksmart\\'] feels like a modern-day \\'Clueless\\' meets \\'Dazed and Confused.\\' I think it has a very, very unusual and fun tone to it. It\\'s a very personal movie... The whole idea of the movie is learning to really see people, and to feel seen yourself. And it\\'s also just really fun. These days, we could use more movies like that.\" In honor of Olivia\\'s project, Wonderwall.com is taking a look at more actresses who are also directors. Keep reading for more... Best supporting actress Oscar winner Angelina Jolie has directed five films including her 2011 debut, \"In the Land of Blood and Honey.\" \"It was an accident -- I wanted to learn more about the war in Yugoslavia,\" she explained at a 2017 Toronto Film Festival panel years later. \"I never thought I could make a movie or write one, it was never part of my plan.\" \"The Hunger Games\" franchise and \"30 Rock\" actress Elizabeth Banks began directing because she was \"bored.\" \"I was a frustrated actress,\" she told The New York Times in 2017, two years after making her directorial debut with \"Pitch Perfect 2.\" She recalled a conversation with some male filmmaker friends regarding what makes a good director. \"They were like, \\'You have no problem telling people what to do,\\'\" Elizabeth recalled. \"You guys,\" she replied, \"thank you so much.\" \"Greenberg\" actress Greta Gerwig became only the fifth women ever to earn a best director Oscar nomination when the Academy recognized her for her 2017 film \"Lady Bird\" in 2018. \"Every year they come out with the numbers. You know, out of the top 100 films, by gross, 4 percent are directed by women. I think those numbers are going to shift. And it seems like it\\'s going to be less and less its own category. There are just going to be ... directors,\" she told Variety in 2018. She also revealed how much she\\'s fallen in love with the job. \"It\\'s simultaneously something that\\'s in your control and utterly not in your control,\" she explained. \"And that paradox is very appealing to me. The illogical nature of making movies is appealing to me as well. It\\'s a reverse magic show. It\\'s so much time and weight and money and people and you\\'re taking all this stuff and you\\'re reducing it to flickering light, making it disappear into a dream. That feels satisfyingly strange.\" Actress Sofia Coppola made the switch to directing -- following in the footsteps of her father, famed director Francis Ford Coppola -- with the feature film \"The Virgin Suicides\" in 1999. She\\'s found great success in filmmaking since, winning the Cannes Film Festival\\'s prestigious best director prize (the second woman to ever have done so!) in 2018 with \"The Beguiled,\" a remake of the 1971 film of the same name. In 2004, she became only the third woman ever to be nominated for a best director Oscar -- for her film \"Lost in Translation -- and though she lost that prize, she did take home an Academy Award for best original screenplay that year. \"Room\" and \"Captain Marvel\" actress Brie Larson made her feature-film directorial debut in 2017 with \"Unicorn Store,\" which was released on Netflix in 2019. \"I\\'ve just made movies my whole life,\" the Oscar winner told IndieWire. \"Every summer, I would write and direct a film that I would direct my cousins in. It mostly took place in the garage, and I would just hang up different sheets and use our storage containers as different heights for things. I had a disco ball that I put outside the garage door, and when I turned it on, it meant we were rolling.\" With this film, she said she shared a new piece of herself. \"There\\'s a real vulnerability that comes with directing a film, that comes with saying, \\'This is my point of view, this is how I view the world, and it\\'s meaningful to me and I hope it\\'s meaningful to other people.\\'\" Former child star-turned-Oscar winner Jodie Foster has been directing movies and television shows since the \\'90s, but looking back on her career, she has some regrets. \"If I have an apology to make for my whole career [as] I\\'m being given my last rites, [it\\'s that] I\\'m really sorry that it was very hard for me to say yes,\" she told IndieWire. \"I didn\\'t make as many movies as I was hoping I would... I do regret that I didn\\'t direct more in all those years, that I only managed to direct four movies in the course of 30 years or something. That\\'s just ridiculous, but I got busy. I had kids. I had a company. I was acting.\" Singer-actress Barbra Streisand is the first -- and only -- woman to win a best director Golden Globe, for 1983\\'s \"Yentl,\" which she also wrote, produced and starred in. In a 2019 interview with The Algemeiner, she admitted that she was not her own first choice to direct the movie, having first pitched it to Milos Forman, who ended up encouraging her to be her own director. Barbra went on to also notably direct \"The Prince of Tides\" and \"The Mirror Has Two Faces.\" Academy Award-winning actress Natalie Portman transitioned to directing with 2015\\'s \"A Tale of Love and Darkness,\" a move she told W Magazine was \"intuitive\" while at the same time \"new and foreign.\" \"It was hard for me to express what I wanted to right away, people are asking you your opinions and guidance a thousand times a day, and my instinct was to apologize for myself and be wishy washy and just say, \\'I don\\'t know,\\' or, \\'you tell me,\\' but you can\\'t be that way as a director. You have to say, \\'This is how I want it.\\' You have to give clear and direct guidance, because they\\'re all there to help you make your vision. It definitely feels like a female thing to me, how I wasn\\'t comfortable being the boss right away. It didn\\'t come naturally to me, I had to learn it,\" she explained. Gabourey Sidibe made her television directorial debut with an episode of \"Empire\" in 2019. \"We have directors for hire so we get new directors all the time. And I see the way they\\'re treated depending on race and gender and experience. I know what fight I\\'m in for,\" the \"Precious\" actress, who also directed the 2016 short film \"The Tale of Four,\" told Essence. \"The hardest of seasoned crew might look at me and say, \\'She doesn\\'t know what she\\'s doing.\\' So before they say that out loud, I have to show up and show them harder and faster that I do know what I\\'m doing. I\\'m the leader and I\\'m going to lead us through this whole thing without taking my hands of the wheel.\" Former child actress Drew Barrymore gave directing a shot with 2009\\'s \"Whip It.\" She opened up about her directing style in an interview with The Scorecard Review. \"I\\'m more performance-oriented. I work next to the camera. I don\\'t use a monitor. I think that whole video-village with a bunch of producer-hens sitting around is total crap,\" she said. \"I would not allow it on my set. I love to work with people right next to the camera and keep the camera rolling. I like doing takes where their natural instincts come out. When you cast people, you want them, so you want what they already have to offer. My favorite takes are when you literally go, \\'Surprise me!\\'\" Kristen Stewart dipped her feet into the directing pool with 2017\\'s \"Come Swim,\" which she also wrote. The short film was shown at the Cannes and Sundance film festivals.

It\\'s basically multitasking. Women were meant to be directors. We were bred to be directors.\" In the \\'90s, Jada Pinkett Smith directed a few video shorts. It took nearly 10 years for her to direct a feature film -- 2008\\'s \"The Human Contract\" starring Paz Vega and Idris Elba. The movie, which she also wrote, was a family affair, as her husband, Will Smith, was the film\\'s executive producer. Courteney Cox transitioned from television star to television director then movie director with 2014\\'s \"Just Before I Go\" starring Seann William Scott. While she\\'s not directed since, she\\'s eager to do it again if the right project comes along. \"I\\'m ready to do it. I read a lot of things that just don\\'t speak to me. You know that you\\'re going to invest so much of your time on a movie when you direct it that it\\'s something that just really has to jump out at you and pull at your heart, and nothing has,\" she told Collider. \"I\\'m anxious to find something, though, because I can\\'t wait to do it again.\" \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" actress Amber Tamblyn didn\\'t plan to helm \"Paint It Black,\" the only movie she\\'s directed so far, in 2016. In an interview with Popsugar, she explained that she got the rights to adapt the book and shopped it around, trying to find the right director for the project. \"So many directors I spoke to had very different visions of the film than what I wanted ... the more I realized that my version was very much my version,\" she said, adding that a director confronted her about it. \"She said to me, \\'You need to direct this. You really need to stop making excuses, and you need to direct it.\\'\" Comedian Whitney Cummings got behind the camera for 2017\\'s \"The Female Brain,\" which she also wrote and starred in. She told The Hollywood Reporter that her most challenging day on set was a unique one -- \"the day I learned that rain machines have two speeds: off and tsunami. They don\\'t tell you this!

For decades, the most well-known and lauded directors in Hollywood have tended to be men. For reference, only one woman has ever won the Academy Award for best director. But more and more women are getting into the field, including Olivia Wilde , who transitions from actress to feature-film director with the comedy \"Booksmart,\" which hits theaters on May 24, 2019. After directing the 2011 short \"Free Hugs,\" Olivia wanted to do it again on a bigger scale. \"I was electrified and I knew at that point, that\\'s what I really wanted to do,\" she told Entertainment Weekly. As for why she chose this project, she explained, \"I\\'m really inspired by the teen comedies that inspired me when I was younger, and [\\'Booksmart\\'] feels like a modern-day \\'Clueless\\' meets \\'Dazed and Confused.\\' I think it has a very, very unusual and fun tone to it. It\\'s a very personal movie... The whole idea of the movie is learning to really see people, and to feel seen yourself. And it\\'s also just really fun. These days, we could use more movies like that.\" In honor of Olivia\\'s project, Wonderwall.com is taking a look at more actresses who are also directors. Keep reading for more... Best supporting actress Oscar winner Angelina Jolie has directed five films including her 2011 debut, \"In the Land of Blood and Honey.\" \"It was an accident -- I wanted to learn more about the war in Yugoslavia,\" she explained at a 2017 Toronto Film Festival panel years later. \"I never thought I could make a movie or write one, it was never part of my plan.\" \"The Hunger Games\" franchise and \"30 Rock\" actress Elizabeth Banks began directing because she was \"bored.\" \"I was a frustrated actress,\" she told The New York Times in 2017, two years after making her directorial debut with \"Pitch Perfect 2.\" She recalled a conversation with some male filmmaker friends regarding what makes a good director. \"They were like, \\'You have no problem telling people what to do,\\'\" Elizabeth recalled. \"You guys,\" she replied, \"thank you so much.\" \"Greenberg\" actress Greta Gerwig became only the fifth women ever to earn a best director Oscar nomination when the Academy recognized her for her 2017 film \"Lady Bird\" in 2018. \"Every year they come out with the numbers. You know, out of the top 100 films, by gross, 4 percent are directed by women. I think those numbers are going to shift. And it seems like it\\'s going to be less and less its own category. There are just going to be ... directors,\" she told Variety in 2018. She also revealed how much she\\'s fallen in love with the job. \"It\\'s simultaneously something that\\'s in your control and utterly not in your control,\" she explained. \"And that paradox is very appealing to me. The illogical nature of making movies is appealing to me as well. It\\'s a reverse magic show. It\\'s so much time and weight and money and people and you\\'re taking all this stuff and you\\'re reducing it to flickering light, making it disappear into a dream. That feels satisfyingly strange.\" Actress Sofia Coppola made the switch to directing -- following in the footsteps of her father, famed director Francis Ford Coppola -- with the feature film \"The Virgin Suicides\" in 1999. She\\'s found great success in filmmaking since, winning the Cannes Film Festival\\'s prestigious best director prize (the second woman to ever have done so!) in 2018 with \"The Beguiled,\" a remake of the 1971 film of the same name. In 2004, she became only the third woman ever to be nominated for a best director Oscar -- for her film \"Lost in Translation -- and though she lost that prize, she did take home an Academy Award for best original screenplay that year. \"Room\" and \"Captain Marvel\" actress Brie Larson made her feature-film directorial debut in 2017 with \"Unicorn Store,\" which was released on Netflix in 2019. \"I\\'ve just made movies my whole life,\" the Oscar winner told IndieWire. \"Every summer, I would write and direct a film that I would direct my cousins in. It mostly took place in the garage, and I would just hang up different sheets and use our storage containers as different heights for things. I had a disco ball that I put outside the garage door, and when I turned it on, it meant we were rolling.\" With this film, she said she shared a new piece of herself. \"There\\'s a real vulnerability that comes with directing a film, that comes with saying, \\'This is my point of view, this is how I view the world, and it\\'s meaningful to me and I hope it\\'s meaningful to other people.\\'\" Former child star-turned-Oscar winner Jodie Foster has been directing movies and television shows since the \\'90s, but looking back on her career, she has some regrets. \"If I have an apology to make for my whole career [as] I\\'m being given my last rites, [it\\'s that] I\\'m really sorry that it was very hard for me to say yes,\" she told IndieWire. \"I didn\\'t make as many movies as I was hoping I would... I do regret that I didn\\'t direct more in all those years, that I only managed to direct four movies in the course of 30 years or something. That\\'s just ridiculous, but I got busy. I had kids. I had a company. I was acting.\" Singer-actress Barbra Streisand is the first -- and only -- woman to win a best director Golden Globe, for 1983\\'s \"Yentl,\" which she also wrote, produced and starred in. In a 2019 interview with The Algemeiner, she admitted that she was not her own first choice to direct the movie, having first pitched it to Milos Forman, who ended up encouraging her to be her own director. Barbra went on to also notably direct \"The Prince of Tides\" and \"The Mirror Has Two Faces.\" Academy Award-winning actress Natalie Portman transitioned to directing with 2015\\'s \"A Tale of Love and Darkness,\" a move she told W Magazine was \"intuitive\" while at the same time \"new and foreign.\" \"It was hard for me to express what I wanted to right away, people are asking you your opinions and guidance a thousand times a day, and my instinct was to apologize for myself and be wishy washy and just say, \\'I don\\'t know,\\' or, \\'you tell me,\\' but you can\\'t be that way as a director.

For decades, the most well-known and lauded directors in Hollywood have tended to be men. For reference, only one woman has ever won the Academy Award for best director. But more and more women are getting into the field, including Olivia Wilde , who transitions from actress to feature-film director with the comedy \"Booksmart,\" which hits theaters on May 24, 2019. After directing the 2011 short \"Free Hugs,\" Olivia wanted to do it again on a bigger scale. \"I was electrified and I knew at that point, that\\'s what I really wanted to do,\" she told Entertainment Weekly. As for why she chose this project, she explained, \"I\\'m really inspired by the teen comedies that inspired me when I was younger, and [\\'Booksmart\\'] feels like a modern-day \\'Clueless\\' meets \\'Dazed and Confused.\\' I think it has a very, very unusual and fun tone to it. It\\'s a very personal movie... The whole idea of the movie is learning to really see people, and to feel seen yourself. And it\\'s also just really fun. These days, we could use more movies like that.\" In honor of Olivia\\'s project, Wonderwall.com is taking a look at more actresses who are also directors. Keep reading for more... Best supporting actress Oscar winner Angelina Jolie has directed five films including her 2011 debut, \"In the Land of Blood and Honey.\" \"It was an accident -- I wanted to learn more about the war in Yugoslavia,\" she explained at a 2017 Toronto Film Festival panel years later. \"I never thought I could make a movie or write one, it was never part of my plan.\" \"The Hunger Games\" franchise and \"30 Rock\" actress Elizabeth Banks began directing because she was \"bored.\" \"I was a frustrated actress,\" she told The New York Times in 2017, two years after making her directorial debut with \"Pitch Perfect 2.\" She recalled a conversation with some male filmmaker friends regarding what makes a good director. \"They were like, \\'You have no problem telling people what to do,\\'\" Elizabeth recalled. \"You guys,\" she replied, \"thank you so much.\" \"Greenberg\" actress Greta Gerwig became only the fifth women ever to earn a best director Oscar nomination when the Academy recognized her for her 2017 film \"Lady Bird\" in 2018. \"Every year they come out with the numbers. You know, out of the top 100 films, by gross, 4 percent are directed by women. I think those numbers are going to shift. And it seems like it\\'s going to be less and less its own category. There are just going to be ... directors,\" she told Variety in 2018. She also revealed how much she\\'s fallen in love with the job. \"It\\'s simultaneously something that\\'s in your control and utterly not in your control,\" she explained. \"And that paradox is very appealing to me. The illogical nature of making movies is appealing to me as well. It\\'s a reverse magic show. It\\'s so much time and weight and money and people and you\\'re taking all this stuff and you\\'re reducing it to flickering light, making it disappear into a dream. That feels satisfyingly strange.\" Actress Sofia Coppola made the switch to directing -- following in the footsteps of her father, famed director Francis Ford Coppola -- with the feature film \"The Virgin Suicides\" in 1999. She\\'s found great success in filmmaking since, winning the Cannes Film Festival\\'s prestigious best director prize (the second woman to ever have done so!) in 2018 with \"The Beguiled,\" a remake of the 1971 film of the same name. In 2004, she became only the third woman ever to be nominated for a best director Oscar -- for her film \"Lost in Translation -- and though she lost that prize, she did take home an Academy Award for best original screenplay that year. \"Room\" and \"Captain Marvel\" actress Brie Larson made her feature-film directorial debut in 2017 with \"Unicorn Store,\" which was released on Netflix in 2019. \"I\\'ve just made movies my whole life,\" the Oscar winner told IndieWire. \"Every summer, I would write and direct a film that I would direct my cousins in. It mostly took place in the garage, and I would just hang up different sheets and use our storage containers as different heights for things. I had a disco ball that I put outside the garage door, and when I turned it on, it meant we were rolling.\" With this film, she said she shared a new piece of herself. \"There\\'s a real vulnerability that comes with directing a film, that comes with saying, \\'This is my point of view, this is how I view the world, and it\\'s meaningful to me and I hope it\\'s meaningful to other people.\\'\" Former child star-turned-Oscar winner Jodie Foster has been directing movies and television shows since the \\'90s, but looking back on her career, she has some regrets. \"If I have an apology to make for my whole career [as] I\\'m being given my last rites, [it\\'s that] I\\'m really sorry that it was very hard for me to say yes,\" she told IndieWire. \"I didn\\'t make as many movies as I was hoping I would... I do regret that I didn\\'t direct more in all those years, that I only managed to direct four movies in the course of 30 years or something. That\\'s just ridiculous, but I got busy. I had kids. I had a company. I was acting.\" Singer-actress Barbra Streisand is the first -- and only -- woman to win a best director Golden Globe, for 1983\\'s \"Yentl,\" which she also wrote, produced and starred in. In a 2019 interview with The Algemeiner, she admitted that she was not her own first choice to direct the movie, having first pitched it to Milos Forman, who ended up encouraging her to be her own director. Barbra went on to also notably direct \"The Prince of Tides\" and \"The Mirror Has Two Faces.\" Academy Award-winning actress Natalie Portman transitioned to directing with 2015\\'s \"A Tale of Love and Darkness,\" a move she told W Magazine was \"intuitive\" while at the same time \"new and foreign.\" \"It was hard for me to express what I wanted to right away, people are asking you your opinions and guidance a thousand times a day, and my instinct was to apologize for myself and be wishy washy and just say, \\'I don\\'t know,\\' or, \\'you tell me,\\' but you can\\'t be that way as a director. You have to say, \\'This is how I want it.\\' You have to give clear and direct guidance, because they\\'re all there to help you make your vision. It definitely feels like a female thing to me, how I wasn\\'t comfortable being the boss right away. It didn\\'t come naturally to me, I had to learn it,\" she explained. Gabourey Sidibe made her television directorial debut with an episode of \"Empire\" in 2019. \"We have directors for hire so we get new directors all the time. And I see the way they\\'re treated depending on race and gender and experience. I know what fight I\\'m in for,\" the \"Precious\" actress, who also directed the 2016 short film \"The Tale of Four,\" told Essence. \"The hardest of seasoned crew might look at me and say, \\'She doesn\\'t know what she\\'s doing.\\' So before they say that out loud, I have to show up and show them harder and faster that I do know what I\\'m doing. I\\'m the leader and I\\'m going to lead us through this whole thing without taking my hands of the wheel.\" Former child actress Drew Barrymore gave directing a shot with 2009\\'s \"Whip It.\" She opened up about her directing style in an interview with The Scorecard Review. \"I\\'m more performance-oriented. I work next to the camera. I don\\'t use a monitor. I think that whole video-village with a bunch of producer-hens sitting around is total crap,\" she said. \"I would not allow it on my set. I love to work with people right next to the camera and keep the camera rolling. I like doing takes where their natural instincts come out. When you cast people, you want them, so you want what they already have to offer. My favorite takes are when you literally go, \\'Surprise me!\\'\" Kristen Stewart dipped her feet into the directing pool with 2017\\'s \"Come Swim,\" which she also wrote. The short film was shown at the Cannes and Sundance film festivals. She is now working on a feature-length film: The \"Twilight\" franchise and \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" actress is adapting Lidia Yuknavitch\\'s 2011 memoir \"The Chronology of Water.\" \"What is directing but multitasking?\" Julie Delpy -- the \"Before Sunrise\" trilogy star who\\'s been directing since 2002 -- joked during an interview with The Guardian in 2018. \"That\\'s all it is. It\\'s basically multitasking. Women were meant to be directors. We were bred to be directors.\" In the \\'90s, Jada Pinkett Smith directed a few video shorts. It took nearly 10 years for her to direct a feature film -- 2008\\'s \"The Human Contract\" starring Paz Vega and Idris Elba. The movie, which she also wrote, was a family affair, as her husband, Will Smith, was the film\\'s executive producer. Courteney Cox transitioned from television star to television director then movie director with 2014\\'s \"Just Before I Go\" starring Seann William Scott. While she\\'s not directed since, she\\'s eager to do it again if the right project comes along. \"I\\'m ready to do it. I read a lot of things that just don\\'t speak to me. You know that you\\'re going to invest so much of your time on a movie when you direct it that it\\'s something that just really has to jump out at you and pull at your heart, and nothing has,\" she told Collider. \"I\\'m anxious to find something, though, because I can\\'t wait to do it again.\" \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" actress Amber Tamblyn didn\\'t plan to helm \"Paint It Black,\" the only movie she\\'s directed so far, in 2016. In an interview with Popsugar, she explained that she got the rights to adapt the book and shopped it around, trying to find the right director for the project. \"So many directors I spoke to had very different visions of the film than what I wanted ... the more I realized that my version was very much my version,\" she said, adding that a director confronted her about it. \"She said to me, \\'You need to direct this. You really need to stop making excuses, and you need to direct it.\\'\" Comedian Whitney Cummings got behind the camera for 2017\\'s \"The Female Brain,\" which she also wrote and starred in. She told The Hollywood Reporter that her most challenging day on set was a unique one -- \"the day I learned that rain machines have two speeds: off and tsunami. They don\\'t tell you this! Nobody tells you this. Maybe they do in film school, I don\\'t know. Actors are in full hair and makeup, extras, camera equipment, turn it on, torrential rainfall all over everybody.

The United States Women's National Team (USWNT) continued their World Cup winning streak with a 3-0 win over Chile in front of 45,594 fans at Parc des Princes in Paris on Sunday. Carli Lloyd had another record-setting day, scoring a brace that bookended a Julie Ertz set-piece goal. With the win, the U.S. remain atop the Group F standings and automatically advance to the Round of 16. The U.S. entered the game looking much different than in their opening match against Thailand. Head Coach Jill Ellis made seven changes to the lineup, including a completely different front three consisting of the USWNT's three subs against Thailand: captain Carli Lloyd , Christen Press, and Mallory Pugh. Julie Ertz, who played center back against Thailand, was pushed back up into the midfield which also saw Morgan Brian start in place of Sam Mewis. Becky Sauerbrunn , out with a quad issue for the Thailand match as a precautionary measure, returned to the U.S. backline, along with Ali Krieger at right back and Tierna Davidson making her World Cup debut at left back. With the start, Davidson is the youngest player to start for the USWNT in a World Cup since Tiffany Roberts in 1995. Ellis also used her substitutions during the match to rotate in the last of the U.S. field players to take the field, giving Jessica McDonald, Allie Long , and Emily Sonnett their World Cup debuts as well. Despite the lineup changes, the U.S. were still the dominant side throughout the duration of the match. The reigning World Cup champions entered the match just as eager to score as they were in their tournament opener. In the opening minutes of the match, Davidson took a U.S. set piece, but Chilean goalkeeper Christiane Endler, who plays club ball for Paris Saint Germain, punched the ball clear. However, she didn't get a good touch on the ball, which fell right to Morgan Brian in front of goal, but the midfielder skied her shot. Moments later, Brian made a run just inside the far side of the box before sending in a low cross intended for Lloyd, but it was disrupted by a Chilean defender's touch. That touch nearly resulted in an own goal, but Endler was able to make the stop. Lloyd was right there and attempted to knock in the rebound and was successful in sneaking it past Endler, but the keeper was able to turn and jump on the ball before it crossed the goal line. ALMOST 1-0! Chile goalkeeper Christiane Endler saves a near own-goal, then Carli Lloyd strikes the post from a tight angle. Big let-off for Chile! #FIFAWWC pic.twitter.com/xa3pPeF0cL   FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) June 16, 2019 A pregame shot of Lloyd in the tunnel showed that the veteran midfielder entered the match visibly hungry to score, and it only took her 11 minutes to curb that hunger. Center back Abby Dahlkemper sent a long ball in front of goal, but Chile's defense got there first. However, the clearance attempt sailed right to Lloyd, who volleyed the ball past Endler for the U.S.'s opening goal. With the goal, Lloyd set a new Women's World Cup record for scoring in six consecutive World Cup matches. After her usual jubilant celebration, Lloyd did a quiet golf clap, a not-so-subtle response to the criticism surrounding the USWNT's goal celebrations in the 13-0 win over Thailand. DREAM START FOR THE USA! pic.twitter.com/C1prZ9HEkW   FOX Sports (@FOXSports) June 16, 2019 Chile looked to have gotten on back because of a goalkeeper blunder in the 23rd minute when they were awarded a free kick within striking distance. Chile sent the ball in, luring Naeher off her line in attempts of collecting the bouncing ball, but she failed to get a hand on the ball, possibly distracted by an impending collision with defender Carla Guerrero. As Naeher and Guerrero both hit the ground, the ball rolled into a wide open goal, seemingly for a Chilean equalizer. Luckily for Naeher and her U.S. teammates, the offside flag went up, preventing Chile from bringing the score back level. Instead, it was the U.S. that struck next through Julie Ertz, who doubled the U.S.'s lead in the 26th minute off a corner kick sent in by Davidson. With her back to the goal, Ertz headed the ball just inside the near post with a shot that Endler was able to get a hand on but not enough to stop. The goal is the first World Cup goal for Ertz, although the defender-turned-midfielder scored an own goal in the 2015 final against Japan. Stop us if you've heard this before... Julie Ertz at the near post! She scores her 1st career #FIFAWWC goal to double the @USWNT lead! pic.twitter.com/S2DpnurNdf   FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) June 16, 2019 Lloyd got her second goal of the day and Davidson her second assist off another U.S. corner kick from the far corner the 36th minute. Davidson used her left foot to send another flawless ball into the box, and Lloyd took to the air to head the ball down, bouncing it past Endler and and into the back of the net to complete the brace. With her 10th career World Cup Goal, the nearly 37-year-old Lloyd set another record by becoming the oldest player to score twice in a Women's World Cup. CARLI LLOYD AGAIN! Her second goal of the game makes it 10 for her #FIFAWWC career and puts the @USWNT up 3-0. pic.twitter.com/aM9lWOyjVL   FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) June 16, 2019 The USWNT entered halftime sitting on a comfortable 3-0 lead. Many fans were expecting another second-half onslaught of goals for the U.S., pointing out that they entered the second half of their match against Thailand with the same scoreline. However, that would not be the case on Sunday. Although the U.S. seemed to move the ball more effectively in the second half and created a number of solid opportunities on goal, they failed to make it past Endler again as the former University of South Florida goalkeeper made a number of world-class saves to keep the USWNT from extending their lead in the start of the second half. In the 55th minute, Christen Press made a run down the far side and was hit in stride by a diagonal pass from Brian, only to cut back the pass in front of goal for Horan, but the midfielder's strike was cleared from the line with a kick save by Endler, who again denied Press in the 66th minute. ENDLER AGAIN! The Chile goalkeeper is standing on her head, this time robbing Christen Press. #FIFAWWC pic.twitter.com/xdmRTyIvc8   FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) June 16, 2019 The woodwork also played a role in preventing the U.S. from getting on the board in the second half, first denying a curling attempt from second-half substitute Jess McDonald before denying Lloyd of a third goal in the 72nd minute. A hat trick seemed to be all but a given for Lloyd after the USWNT were controversially awarded a penalty kick in the 80th minute after Allie Long was fouled at the very top of the box. After the official consulted Video Assistant Referee (VAR), she pointed to the spot, and Lloyd stepped up to take the penalty kick. Facing off against Endler one-on-one, Carli attempted to complete another World Cup-hat trick, but she sent her low shot wide of the far post. Carli Lloyd hits her penalty wide and misses a chance to become the first woman to score 2 career #FIFAWWC hat tricks. pic.twitter.com/90L2QEJsqy   FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) June 16, 2019 Of some concern to the USWNT is that both Lindsey Horan and Allie Long picked up yellow cards in the match. According to World Cup rules, players who pick up two yellow cards will face a one-game suspension. With Sweden looming on the horizon, Horan especially will need to be careful so as to not pick up a second booking just before the elimination round begins. The USWNT will next close out group play against Sweden on Thursday, June 20 at 3 p.m. ET.\""]},"execution_count":307,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df1[\"article3_body\"][0]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":46,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["Index(['Unnamed: 0.1', 'Unnamed: 0', 'User1', 'User2', 'commonnewsID',\n","       'article1_ID', 'article1_title', 'article1_rewritetitles',\n","       'article2_ID', 'article2_title', 'article2_rewritetitles',\n","       'article3_ID', 'article3_title', 'article3_rewritetitles',\n","       'LlamaChat-7B', 'Mistral-v0.2-Instruct', 'Orca2-7B', 'StableBeluga7B',\n","       'Tulu2-7B', 'Zephyr-beta'],\n","      dtype='object')"]},"execution_count":46,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df1.columns"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["df1[\"article2_rewritetitles\"] = df1[\"article2_rewritetitles\"].apply(eval)\n","# df1[\"EXTRACTED\"] = df1[\"EXTRACTED\"].apply(eval)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":231,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 0.1</th>\n","      <th>Unnamed: 0</th>\n","      <th>User1</th>\n","      <th>User2</th>\n","      <th>commonnewsID</th>\n","      <th>article1_ID</th>\n","      <th>article1_title</th>\n","      <th>article1_rewritetitles</th>\n","      <th>article1_body</th>\n","      <th>article2_ID</th>\n","      <th>...</th>\n","      <th>Mistral-v0.1</th>\n","      <th>Mistral-v0.2-Instruct</th>\n","      <th>Orca2-13B</th>\n","      <th>Orca2-7B</th>\n","      <th>StableBeluga-13B</th>\n","      <th>StableBeluga-7B</th>\n","      <th>Tulu-13B</th>\n","      <th>Tulu-7B</th>\n","      <th>Zephyr-alpha</th>\n","      <th>Zephyr-beta</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>NT1</td>\n","      <td>NT2</td>\n","      <td>['N114208', 'N107124', 'N54921', 'N22221', 'N2...</td>\n","      <td>N96850</td>\n","      <td>Patriots roster breakdown: CB D'Angelo Ross</td>\n","      <td>[\"An overview on Patriots roster: D'Angelo Ros...</td>\n","      <td>The undrafted rookie faces an uphill battle to...</td>\n","      <td>N51080</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>[ \", ]</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Jony Ive: The Apple Designer with a Massive...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Apple's Design Chief Jony Ive Leaves the Co...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Apple Design Chief Jony Ive Leaves Company,...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Apple Chief Designer Jony Ive Leaves Compan...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Apple Design Chief Jony Ive Leaves Company ...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Apple’s Design Chief Jony Ive Leaves the Co...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Jony Ive Leaves Apple, Launches Independent...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Nike Faces Backlash for Pulling 'Betsy Ross...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Nike's Controversial 'Betsy Ross Flag' Snea...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>NT1</td>\n","      <td>NT3</td>\n","      <td>['N88367', 'N11699', 'N10383', 'N101415', 'N63...</td>\n","      <td>N11436</td>\n","      <td>Trump tweets video showing him running for pre...</td>\n","      <td>['Trump tweets a mused edited video imagining ...</td>\n","      <td>President Trump on Friday shared an edited vid...</td>\n","      <td>N10383</td>\n","      <td>...</td>\n","      <td>[ \", \"]</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Powerball Jackpot Reaches $165 Million: Cou...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Nike's 'Betsy Ross Flag' Sneakers Controver...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Nike's Controversial Flag Sneakers and Cost...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Powerball Jackpot Grows to $165 Million, Ni...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Powerball Jackpot Soars to $165 Million for...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Powerball Jackpot hits $165 Million for Jul...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Nike Faces Criticism After Dropping Betsy R...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Powerball Jackpot Reaches $165 Million for ...</td>\n","      <td>[ \"Powerball Jackpot Reaches $165 Million for ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>NT1</td>\n","      <td>NT7</td>\n","      <td>['N82665', 'N97261', 'N22221', 'N25688', 'N150...</td>\n","      <td>N97261</td>\n","      <td>Paul Rudd Announces He's Joining 'Ghostbusters...</td>\n","      <td>[\"What's new in Ghostbusters 3?
